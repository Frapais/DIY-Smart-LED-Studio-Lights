# DIY Smart LED Studio Lights üîßüí°

This project documents how I converted a cheap AliExpress LED studio panel into a **smart, WiFi-connected, Home Assistant-controlled light** using my custom hardware modules and 3D printed components.

The goal was to build a modular, open-source alternative to expensive smart lights ‚Äî complete with **PWM dimming**, **warm/cool white mixing**, and **portable battery power**.

## üß† Features

- ESP32-C3-based control using the [**Sprig**](https://sprig-labs.com/sprig-esp32-development-board) dev board
- Dual-channel MOSFET switching via the [**Thorn**](https://sprig-labs.com/thorn-dual-mosfet-controller) module
- Independent control of warm and cool white LEDs
- Control and automation via **ESPHome + Home Assistant**
- DC-DC buck converter for battery regulation
- 3D printed mounting plate for the back of the LED panel
- Clean cable routing and screw mounting

## ‚ö° Wiring Guide

1. Connect Sprig Thorn MOSFET
2. Route the MOSFET outputs to the LED panel's warm and cool channels
3. Power the Sprig and LEDs via the buck converter from the battery
4. Optional: Add inline fuse or switch
