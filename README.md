# DIY Smart LED Studio Lights üîßüí°

This project documents how I converted a cheap AliExpress LED studio panel into a **smart, WiFi-connected, Home Assistant-controlled light** using my custom hardware modules and 3D printed components.

The goal was to build a modular, open-source alternative to expensive smart lights ‚Äî complete with **PWM dimming**, **warm/cool white mixing**, and **portable battery power**.

## ‚ö° Wiring Guide

1. Connect the [Sprig](https://www.tindie.com/products/spriglabs/sprig-esp32-c3-development-board/) microcontroller to the [Thorn](https://www.tindie.com/products/spriglabs/thorn-dual-mosfet-controller/) module
2. Route the MOSFET outputs to the LED panel's warm and cool channels
3. Power the Sprig and LEDs via the buck converter from the battery
4. Optional: Add inline fuse or switch
